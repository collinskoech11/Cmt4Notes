            <h3>First generation  1940 to 1956 </h3>
            <p>They were huge slow expensive and often unreliable</p>
            
            <p>In 1946 Two Americans by the name of Presper Eckert & William Mauchly  Build an  electronic numeric iterator and computer which was ENIAC. And it used vacuum tubes in stead of mechanic switches </p>
            
            <p>In 1941 the two gentlemen built the UNIVAC which could calculator at the rate of 1000 additions per second <br/>
            There were new technologies developed at this stage : <br/>
            i) Vacuum tube – The vacuum tube was n important advancement <br/>
                                        an electronic tube about the size of a light bulb was used for internal computer  <br/>  			     components and were used in thousands 
            ii) Punched Card –  This was used  to store data <br/>
            iii)Magnetic Tape – This was introduced in 1957 It was faster and more compact method of storing data 	<br/>		     and their use was more reliable & cost effective 
                        (Floppy Disk)</p>
            
            
            <h3>CHALLENGES </h3>
            <p>i)Vacuum tubes generated a lot of heat causing many problems in temperature regulation and climate control <br/>
            ii)The tubes burnt out frequently 
            Challenge with programming machines </p>
            
            
            <h3>Second Generation 1956 1963</h3>
            
            
            <p> There were three main scientists involved in the second generation John Barden , Walter  Houser Brattain & William Shockley 
            Creation of transistors sparked the production of a second generation computers 
            Transistors were small devices used to transfer small  electronic signals across a resistor
            Transistors had many advantages compared to other</p>
            
            <h3>Advantages </h3>
            <p>i)Smaller than the vacuum tubes 
            Needed no warm up time <br/>
            ii)Consumed less energy <br/>
            iii) Generated less heat <br/>
            iv) Faster and more reliable</p>
            
            <h3>Third Generation 1964 1971</h3>
            
            <p>in This era the IBM 370 series was introduced in 1964
            It came in several models and sizes
            The development of integrated circuits signals the beginning of the third generation of computers
            Silicon chips were manufactured in 1961 in the silicon valley
            Integrated Circuits Technology reduced the size and cost of computers 
            IC’s Complete electronic circuit with a small chip of silicon which is used as a semiconductor
            Magnetic core memory was replaced by the Microchip 
            It was during this generation the first 256 bit ram was introduced </p>
            
            <h3>Advantages </h3>
            <p>i)The silicon chips were reliable cheaper and compact hardware and software were now sold separately 
                and thus the software industry was created <br/>
            ii)Customer service industry flourished </p>
            
            
            <h3>Fourth Generation 1971 to Present </h3>

                <h3>Problems by ICT </h3>
                Pligarism <br/>
                <h3>Computer Ethics</h3>
                There are three major areas <br/>
                Copyright<br/>
                Netiquette<br/> 
                Daay to Day ethic<br/>
               Intellectual Property: Creation of intellect i.e Inventions Neutral and artistic works Symbols Name sImages and designs <br/>
                    It is divided into 
                    i)Industrial property: Protects inventions <br/>
                    ii) Copyright:Protects Litteral and artistic work<br/>




            <h3>Netiquette</h3> are the verious   relating to usage of the internet  Its about proper ways to use a network and determine whether the information is reliable While emphasising Four important factors 
                i) Real people exist behind the computers 
                    - It is important to consider that as you send in the chat window remember you are dealing with people not machines (Think Twice)
                    - REmeber you are not the one using the network/Internet 
                    - Keep other people in mind as you share sth on the network /interne =-t 
                ii) Protect your private data 
                    -  Just as you would in the real world take note 
                    fraud 
                    false info on the internet 
                    Use common sense to determine whether the info is valid
                    Dont further spread information with which you are in doubt.
                    Always try not to further spread unreliable info 
                    Protect your personal information To acoid malicious activities on the data 

                iii) Spamming : Sending of unsolicited  bulk and/or commercial messages over the internet 
                    - It is morally bad as it is intended to destroy and done by infringing on the right of privacy by others 
                    - It is good  that the message sent benefits the recipient 
                
                iv) Help make the network better 
                 - Existance of the information society is based on
                 making a contribution is an essential part of building a network 
            <h3>Software Piracy</h3>
             It is morally bad to reproduce a copy of software and sell it for free or produce exactly the same or similar version without credditting the author 
              <h3>Creation of Worms or computer viruses </h3> 

              It is unethical especially when intended for malicious purposes 
             <h3> Pligarism </h3>
              Copying someones work and passing it off as your own  
              <h3>Hacking</h3>
              ILlegally accessing other peoples systems to either destroy disrupt or carry out illegal activity 
              Hacking is morally bad if it is intended to steal private info and destroy a computer system 
              <h3>File Privacy</h3>
              Any Document produced aither by an individual made privately must remain private 
              No one should open the document unless authorised by the individual       
            



            **To sum all that up 
            - <h3>Top ten rules of computer ethics </h3>
            --Thou shall not use a computer to harm other people 
            -- Thoun  shall not interfere with other people s computer work 
            --THou shall not snoop around other peoples computers 
            -- THou shall not use a computer to bare false witness
            -- Thou shall not copy or use propretory software for which is unpaid for 
            --THou shall not use other peoples comp resources without authorisation
            -- Thou shall not appropriate other peoples intellectual output
            -- Thou shall think about the social consequences of the programm you are writing 
            --Thou shall always use a copmputer in ways that ensure respect of fellow humans



            ** Difference between ethics and laws 
            Law is a legal system comprisinfg of lrules that govern the affairs of a community and controll policy of a community 
            Law differ from one country to another 
            computer laws refer to all areas that 
            In Kenya -- we have the compuer misuse and cyber crimes act of 2018
            --KenyA Intellectual property act 
        

        <h3>Why do we need ethics and laws in computing for : </h3>
        i) REspecting ownership 
        ii) Respecting Privacy 
        iii) Respecting Property

        <h3>Respecting ownership</h3>
        --by not stealing other peoples wrk either by duplicating or distributing 

        <h3>Respecting Privacy</h3>
        We should resp[ect other peoples privacy by refraining from reading other peoples mails or files without their permission 

        <h3>REspecting property</h3>
        INdividuals data or info is considered property therefore an act of manipulatio=ng it is disrespect of property
            



        <h3>Utility Models/ Petty Patent </h3>
        There are certain innovations that dont need  to be entiely new , It might be new in kenya but not neccesarily in the world THe newness need not to be an invention 

        <h4>Petty Patent - Patent on utility model</h4>
        <h4>Patent </h4>
        <h3>TRademark</h3>

         <h3>Copyright</h3>

         Potects Original expressions enboded in material, tangible or fixed form 
         It starts with an idea, its expresssed then the expression is embedded in material form
         e.g - Writer gets an idea to write  writes down on a piece of paper then publishes a book
          Ideas are not protected in the intellectual property but expressions are 

          Copyright is dynamic in 3 main areas 
          i) Software
          ii) LIterature 
          iii) Entertainment

        Trade Secrets - Reffered to as Undisclosed Information They're also called confidential information

        Have two main characteristics:
        Information must be secret or confidential that is not disclosed to other people 
        Information must have commercial value - REason for confidentiality
        THere must be an obligation to keep that information a secret that is confidential obligation that is done through non-disclosure agreement clause in the contract of employment And theyre protected under intellectual property

        Patents exist for a lease of 20 years 
        <h3>Privacy </h3>
        
        Refers to data and information security <br/>
        Data is collection of raw facts  THe data is then procceseed into information 
        <h3>Information Privacy</h3>
         - THe rights of individuals and companies to deny or restrict the collection and use of information around them 
         <h3>Ways Computer Technology Threatens Our Privacy</h3>
            Electronic profile is the combining of data into a database that can be sold to other interestedparties<br/>
            The information in the electronic profile includes personal details such as age address marital status<br/>
            Privacy is affected when personal information is shared to other companies without your consent<br/>
            1) Further the user begins to receive content that they had not requested<br/>
