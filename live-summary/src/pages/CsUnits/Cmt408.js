                    <h3>Introduction to Software project management</h3>
        -----------------------------------------------
        

        purpose <br/>
        ---------
        -Understand the efficient techniques of <br/>

        <h3>Definition of terms</h3><br/>
        --------------------
        -differenciate between -data and information   - Information  is processed , organised data presented in a  given context and is usedful to humans.<br/>
                                                        while  data is an individual unit that contain raw material which does not carries any specific meaning.<br/>
                              -Knowledge and intelligence - retained information while intelligence is knowledge or rather expert know<br/>
        -process - is a kind of interelated  action or activities performed to achieve a set of product service results.<br/>
        -project -is a defined or rather plan undertaked or related activities to reach an objective that has a beginning and end <br/>
                - a temporary endeveavior undertaken to create a unique product on services.<br/>
                
       <h3> characteristic of computer project </h3>
        ---------------------------------------
            - plan <br/>
            -unique<br/>
              -Non routine<br/>
            - it requires planning <br/>
            -Predefined timeline, that is a start and end.<br/>
            
        -project involves different  specialist<br/>
        -project involves  several phases.<br/>


       <h3> 1)what is the difference between software project  and construction project/ other projects</h3><br/>
        ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>
        -visibility - S/w project is very hard to see the progress unlike the construction project.<br/>
        -protype - 
        -complexity - s/w project errors/bugs can be  solve while for construction, you demolish to solve the error.<br/>
        - In Constraction site you dont need a chart to see progress, It takes shapes right infront of you, <br/>
          while in software office it takes a little time to get used to the fact that everyone spend their day in <br/>
          front of a screen.<br/>
          -A construction project is all about the deployment of scarce and valuable resources such are<br/>
          materials, plant and labor unlike the software developement that requires few talented people and some <br/>
          reasonable comfortable seats.<br/>
          -Construction is a waterfall process, first you dig a hole, then you build the fundation. Each<br/>
          step is necessary to cascade down to the next step on the next project program unlike the software<br/>
            which  is largely modular, you can build the parts or features separately and glue them together.<br/>

       <h3> N/B Group discussion AND PRESENTATION(NEXTWEEK)</h3>
        ===============================================<br/>
        4)with an aid/m of a diagram Discuss the  five process group and their deliverables(the reports)(five marks)<br/>
        ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>
        -Initiating phase - triggers the planning process group.<br/>
                          
        -Planning phase -  triggers the execution process group.<br/>
        -Execution - is the phase where the most ofthe project work is delivered.<br/>
        -Monitoring and controlling - is the only project management process group that iteract with other four.<br/>
                                    It is in this phase where project team checks whether everything is <br/>
                                    going as planned<br/>
        -Closing - helps to close the project after all objective are met<br/>
        5)Discuss the 9 knowledge areas as defined in pmbok  by (project mgt institute/pmi)<br/>
        ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
       <h3> -Project integration management</h3> - includes such fundamental plans as developing a  project charter <br/>
                                          charter that id created during the initiation phase.<br/>
                                        - Another aspect of this area is the project management plan<br/>
                                          which is developed as a project roadmap for the project to reach<br/>
                                          as successful end.<br/>
                                          
        <h3>-Project scope management</h3> - This includes  plan scope management, which is part of the project management plan.<br/>
                                  
       <h3> -Project Time managememt </h3>- the project is divided into task, which are scheduled with start dates and deadline<br/>
                                  as well as budget for  each task.<br/>
                                  
       <h3> -Project cost management</h3> -  this area involves the project budget, which means having good estimating tools to <br/>
                                    to make sure that the funds covers the entent of the project and are being monitored <br/>
                                    reglarly to keep stakeholders or sponsor informed.<br/>
                                    
       <h3> -project Quality management - </h3>
       <h3> -project human resource management -</h3> human resource management plan will identify their  roles and <br/>
                                            roles and their   requirement  for those positions, as well as how they<br/>
                                              fit in the overall project stucture.<br/>
                                              
       <h3> -projet  communication management - </h3>

        <h3>7)differenciate btw  PERT chart , GANT chart</h3>
        ----------------------------------------
        -Gantt chart is a bar chart that lays out project tasks and timelines linearly while PERT is<br/>
        network diagram that displays all the project tasks in separate boxies and connect them with arrows<br/>
          to clearly clear show task dependencies.<br/>
        -PERT  can define all task and activites required for project, the develop a realistic timeframe for project competion.<br/>
        while Cantt is used to check how long each task is exprected to take , also great for visualizing<br/>
        the order of specific tasks as well as the teams and individuals responsible for each task.<br/>

      <h3>  8)-Discuss  the 4 constraints of a project / sw project (time, scope, quality)</h3>
        ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
        -Time constraint - refers to the project's shedule for completion, including the deadline <br/>
                          for each phase.<br/>
                          
        -Scope constaint - the scope of a project defines its specific goals, deliverables, features and <br/>
                          functions.<br/>
        -Cost constraint - comprises all of the financial resources needed to complete the project on time<br/>

        -----------------<br/>

       <h3> Project life cycle management </h3>
        -----------------------------------
        -Process of managing the entire lifecycle of a product from inception, through  engineering design and disposal of a<br/>
        manufactured products.<br/>
        - It has the following phases:<br/>
                                ideal generation<br/>
                                idea screen <br/>

        <h3>Project management</h3>
        ------------------------
        -Temporary endeavor undertaken to create a unique product, service or result.<br/>
        -Application of knowledge  skills, tools,  and techniques to project activities to meet the project requirement.<br/>



        -Ability to deliver project on schedule, on budget and aligned with business goal is key to<br/>
        gaining an edge in today's highly competitve globak business environment.<br/>
        -IT company engage in software development can be seen  split in two parts:<br/>
                      software creation<br/>
                      software project management<br/>
                      
       <h3> project</h3>
        ---------
        -Project is well defined task, which is a collection of several operations done in order to achieve a goal<br/>
        -A  project can be characterised as:<br/>
                      unique with distinct goals.<br/>
                      Not a routine activity or da to day operation.<br/>
                      it comes with starting and ending time<br/>
                      It ends with its goal achieved.<br/>
                      It requires adequate resources in terms of time, manpower finance materials.<br/>
                      
                      
       <h3> Software project</h3>
        -----------------------<br/>
        -A complete procedure of software development from requirement gathering <br/>
          to testing and maintanance.<br/>
        -carried out according to   the executing methodologies, in a specification period of time to achive intendent software products.<br/>
        
        Why do we need software project management<br/>
        ---------------------------------------------<br/>
        -software products are tailor made to fit client requirement.<br/>
        -Underlying technology changes and advances so frequently and rapidly tha experience  of one product may not be  <br/>
        applied to the other one.<br/>
        -The triple constaints for software project are:<br/>
                          time<br/>
                          scope<br/>

        -----------------------<br/>
        -Performed  before the productions of software actually starts.<br/>
        -Rather is it a set of multiple processes, which facilitaes software production.<br/>
        -May include:<br/>
                    Scope management - includes all the activites , process need to be done in order to make a<br/>
                                        a deliverable software product.<br/>
                                        -It is essential because it  boundaries of the project by clearly defining <br/>
