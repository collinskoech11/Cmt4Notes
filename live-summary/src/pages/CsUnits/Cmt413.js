            <h1>CMT 413 NETWORK AND SYSTEM ADMINISTRATION</h1>

            <h2>Applying technology in an environment </h2>

                <p> → The key task of network and system administration is to build the hardware configurations and the other  is to configure software systems <br/>
                → Both of these tasks(Hardware and Software configure software systems <br/>
                → Both of these functions presents their own challenges i.e  hardware configuration challenges and none of these challenges can be considered in isolation <br/>
                → The hardware must conform to the constraints of the physical world <br/>
                → Such challenges include : power, climate <br/>
                → The kind of hardware limits the software that can run on it <br/>
                → The hardware constraints affect the performance to basic standards in order to work systematically <br/>
                → For software configuration, basic operating system, infrastructure are key to conformance standards <br/>
                → Modern software in the context of global network  need to interact and survive possible hostilities of the incompatible  or inhospitable competitors <br/>
                → Today the complexity of multiple software systems sharing a common internet space reaches almost the level of the biological <br/>
                → In today’s networks, our focus is not only in the physical environment but the technology environment <br/>
                →The challenge with the technology environment is that it is constantly changing <br/>
                → we apply technology in these changing environments for the purposes of running businesses and other practices <br/>
                → The global view presented to us by IT  means that we have to think on penetration for the systems that are going to be deployed <br/>
                → The extensive filaments of our inter-networked systems are exposed to attacks both accidental and malicious in a competitive jungle <br/>
                → If you ignore the environment you expose then organization you IT assets to an immeasurable risk <br/>

                <h3>The Human Role in Systems </h3>

                → For the part of the human tasks of the system administration is a very careful balancing task <br/>
                → This task quires patience knowledge  understanding and experience <br/>
                → The human tasks in systems can be compared to be equivalent to working in a casualty ward in hospitals <br/>
                → despite this diamante system admins work with limited resources and computer systems are subjected to entropy <br/>
                * As a system admin you must recognize that answers are not always written down for you to copy <br/>
                → One important aspect for a system  designer and admin is to remain calm when problems happen and attentive and moreover he/she must continually keep learning because of the changing environment <br/>
                → Computing systems require the very best of organization skill at the most professional of attitudes <br/>
                → In order for us to become very good system admin we must learn the facts that build confidence through expertise and experience, However you must be aware of our limitations to avoid careless mistakes which are too easy to commit <br/>

                <h3>System requirements </h3>
                <p> Ethic – <br/>
                Discipline –<br/>
                </p>
                <h3>Challenges for System administrators</h3>
                <p>
                → Deciding what services are needed <br/>
                → Designing a network which is logical and efficient<br/>
                → Providing a comfortable environment for the users<br/>
                → Deploying large no of machines which can be upgraded  later<br/>
                → Planning and implementing adequate security <br/>
                → Developing Ways of fixing errors and problems which occur <br/>
                → Keeping track of and understanding use of the enormous amount of knowledge which increases every year</p>


               <h3> Top Down Network design </h3>

               <p>1 Understanding customer design <br/>
                2 Logical Network Design <br/>
                3 Physical Network Design <br/>
                4 Testing Optimization & documenting your network design </p> 

               <h3> Understanding customer needs and  goals </h3>

                <p>
                → Analyzing business goals and constraints <br/>
                → Analyzing technical goals and constraints <br/>
                → Characterizing the existing inter networks <br/>
                → Characterizing Network traffic </p>


               <p>when analyzing the system goals which determine your customer needs must incorporate the new and the existing applications 
                NB It is not necessary that you only design a new network but you can improve on the already existing infrastructure 
                The key point is to analyze what will affect the network design </p> 

               <h3> Politics and Policies </h3>
                <p>In normal situation there are two things we avoid that’s politics ,  and religion  unfortunately the politics in technology is something we can never escape as designers <br/>
                In case of office politics the best bet is to listen rather than talk <br/>
                Your goal as a network designer is to understand the hidden agenda ,  tag wars biases group relations or history behind a project</p> 

                <p> Be sure to find out if your project will cost any jobs to be eliminated </p>

               <p>NB  Suppose a similar project was tried and never worked tread on that project carefully and identify reasons why the project failed 
                pay attention to Personnel issues that could affect your project <br/>
                Investigate the managers who started the project and how much stake they had then <br/>
                Some network design projects  involve automating tasks that were once done by highly paid workers , such workers would work so hard to ensure your project fails <br/>
                Investigate whether there exists a strategic bussiness or it plan <br/>
                Your role as a designer is to ensure that the solution mast map to the overall strategic plan of the org <br/>
                to do this you ask yourself some fundamental qn such as <br/>
                → Does my network design need to fit in the overall architecture that is based on strategic planning <br/>
                → Are The external regulatory or govt pressures affecting your design <br/>
                Be prepared for possibility of formidable office politics <br/>
                If your design/solution involves merging data and voice <br/>
                Voice experts and data experts have traditionally lived a world apart and the greatest misfit between these two is mistrust <br/>

                Understand the nature of the client and gain a feeling fr the client business style <br/>
                You must know the client business style <br/>

                Skills to develop <br/>
                Humanistic skill <br/>
                conceptual skill <br/>
                Technological skill <br/>

                <h3>Budgetary and Staffing Constraints</h3>
                Your network design must fit the customers budget<br/>
                Budget must include <br/>
                → Equipment purchase <br/>
                → Software license <br/>
                → Maintenance and support agreement <br/>
                → Testing <br/>
                → Training <br/>
                → Staffing <br/>
                → Consulting fees <br/>
                → Outsourcing expenses<br/>
                
                Within the budget work out closely with the client to identify requirements for new personnel<br/>
                Equally identify personnel training which will affect the budget of the project <br/>

                In general it is a good idea to analyze the ability of the networking staff<br/>
                To do this we focus on the following <br/>
                → How much house expertise is there <br/>
                → Should you recommend any training or outsourcing for network operations and management <br/>
                ** to answer these questions the protocols you recommend will depend on abilities of the internal staff<br/>
                The choice between in-house expertise and outsourced facilities is important and challenging such that a careful balance must be maintained <br/>
                To ensure success of the project determine who controls the network budget <br/>
                Regardless of who controls the budget one common network  design goal is to contain costs <br/>
                Reduced budgets or limited resources often force designers to go for the most affordable solution instead of the best solution <br/>
                If possible work with your customer to come up with ROI(Return on investment) for the network design <br/>
                Usually make a business case to the consumer that explains how quickly the new network pay for itself due to reduced operational costs, Improved employee productivity or the enabling of  higher revenue on market expansion<br/>

                ** concept paper for a company of choice to show how you are going to design the network and implement it Implication of the proposed design to the current design and justify why the org should adopt your design <br/>

                Characterizing the existing inter networks <br/>
                <h3>Project Schedule </h3>
                After our budgets have fallen in place both the project team and the customer sit down and and have an agreed timeline on how the project will be implemented details emerge answering the following qns<br/>
                1:When is the final due date<br/>
                2:What are the intermediate milestones <br/>
                3:What are the major milestones<br/>

                In most cases the management of the project schedule it is the responsibility of the customer not the network design and implmentation team <br/>
                Once the Schedule has been agreed , both the customer and the implementatiion team keep their copies of the document  <br/>

                If possible use a tool in developing your schedule that includes milestones resource assignments critical path analysis  Take a look at this aspect of the schedule and before starting the project evaluate whether this project is practical considering all the info you have about the scope of the project<br/>
                An agresssive Implementation schedule may require reduction but that reduction has nothing to do with reduction of the quality of our works and the following must prove that <br/>
                -Test results yield results 
                No compromise on functionality as initially intended <br/>
                NB To achieve this quality planning is neccessary and can only be achieved  during the technical analysis stage and the logical and physical design phases of the project <br/>
                AS you do this  keep the schedule in mind <br/>
            
                <h3>Understanding customer needs and Goals</h3>
                -Analyzing business goals and constraints<br/>
                -Analyzing technical goals and constraints<br/>
                -Characterizing  the existing internetworks <br/>
                -Characterizing Network traffic<br/>

                Consider the avriations that can occur and factor the time as an important factor<br/>

                <h3>Checklist For project schedule </h3>


                It is never easy to produce a project schedule : However the following checklist can help us to be very objective on our project schedule<br/>
                1) Ensure you undesrtand the customer's cooperate culture.<br/>
                2) Ensure that the customer has dientified any mission critical operations <br/>
                3) Ensure that you have researched the customers industry and competition<br/>
                4) Ensure you understand the customers criteria for success and ramifications for failiure<br/>
                5) Ensure that you understand customers network aopplication , You have identified them using a <a href="https://www.google.com/search?client=opera&q=network+application+chart&sourceid=opera&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8">network application chart </a> <br/>
                6) Let the customer explain to you policies regarding approved vendors, protocols or platforms <br/>
                7) Ensure the customer has explained any policies regarding distributed authoritiy for network design and administration<br/>
                8) Ensure that you know the budget<br/>
                9) Ensure that you undesrtandthe customers bussiness goals starting with overall goal that explains the primary purpose of the network design<br/>
                10) Ensure you know the schedule of the project including due date and major milestones that are practical<br/>
                11) Ensure that you have technical expertise of the client and relevant internal and external staff<br/>
                13) Dicuss staff education and training plan <br/>
                12) Beware and Understand any office politics that might affect your network design<br/>

                <strong>For a successsful project schedule we strat with understanding the corporate structure which helps us to understand the data flow in the organisation, Develop a network topology which is parallel to corporate structure This eventually helps managers(project managers who will have the authoritiy to accept or reject the network deign ) This conflict is essential to allow us to come up with a proper network design</strong><br/>

                    <h4>
                       ** Lecture 4
                    </h4>

                <h3>Checking the health of the Existing Systems</h3>
                
                    Its important to have a healthy reliable network : A failing network can affect services , leading to poor customer and user experienc, and ultimately leading to loss of revenue
                    THerefore it is important to adopt a proactive approach to maintaining the health of your next generation networks<br/>
                    
                    Most service provider consider only the bandwidth and latency issues in determining network health  and ignore the implications of security and loads on the server; heavy server loads can result in extended increase  the chances of intrusion from viruses. THe following steps will keep your network in good health:<br/>
