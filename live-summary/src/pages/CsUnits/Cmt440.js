               <h3> Supervised learning</h3>
                -----------------------
                -Analogous to training a child to walk.<br/>
                
               <h3> Regression<br/></h3>
                -------------
                -Similar to supervised learning accept  that you give a concrete known examples to the<br/>
                computer.<br/>
                
              <h3>  Classification </h3>
                ---------------
                -You classify objects of similar nature into a single groups.<br/>
                
              <h3>  Unsupervised learning</h3>
                ---------------------
                -Do not  specify a target variable to the machine, rather we ask machine what it can tell about a<br/>
                specific object.<br/>
                -To reach at this point the is a large number  of dataset  points that  the machine would require to <br/>
                deduce .<br/>
                -For the case of supervised a machine need to be trained with even few thousands of data points.<br/>
                -For the cause of unsupervised learning, the number of data point that is reasonable <br/>
                accepted for learning start in a few millions.<br/>
                -data idealy requires  curating.<br/>
                -Data Curating - is the organisation and integration  of data collection from various source.<br/>
                                - It involve annotation, publication and presentation of data such that the value of the data is maintained over time.<br/>
                                    and data remains available  for reuse and preservation.<br/>
                                    
             <h3>   Reinforcement learning </h3>
                ----------------------
                -Initially developed for machine to play Games.<br/>
                -The machine is given an algorithm  to analyze all possible moves at each  stage of the game.<br/>
                -The machine can select one of the move at random.<br/>
                -If the move is right,  the machine is rewarded, otherwise it may be penalized.<br/>
                -Slowly the machine started differenciating between right and wrong moves.<br/>
                -After a several iteration it started it would learn to solve the game puzzle with a better accuracy.<br/>
                -The accuracy of winning the game would improve as  the machine plays more and more games.<br/>
                
                
              <h3>  How does the supervised learning different from the  reinforcement learning </h3>
                ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                -Reinforcement learning need not supply the labelled input/output pairs.<br/>
                their focus is on finding the  the balance  betweeen exploring new solution verse exploiting the<br/>
                learned  solution.<br/>
